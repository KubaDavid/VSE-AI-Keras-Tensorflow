# Keras and Tensorflow
This repo contains the last seminar work from VÅ E AI.

This work focuses on the study and development of neural networks for text data classification. It aims to investigate how efficiently and effectively these networks can process and categorize data. In particular, it focuses on sentiment analysis in texts, which means determining whether the content of a text is positive or negative. The research used a specific dataset containing Amazon customer reviews. The process of writing and editing code was done in a Jupiter notebook environment using Google Colab and VSCode, using skills learned in the exercises and extending existing code.
